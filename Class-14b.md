## What makes the perfect team?
To have a great team, there is no surefire recipe for success. A combination of solid leadership, communication, and access to good resources contribute to productive collaboration, but it all comes down to having people who understand each other and work well together.
## What are the 5 roles of an effective team?
Here are five roles of an effective team: 
* Leaders.
* Creative Director. 
* Facilitator.
* Coach.
* Member. 
All these are essential components of a team, but they need not be exclusive.

## What do good leaders do?
Leaders help themselves and others to do the right things. They set direction, build an inspiring vision, and create something new. Yet, while leaders set the direction, they must also use management skills to guide their people to the right destination, in a smooth and efficient way.

## What qualities did Google find to be the most important in high performing teams?
1. Psychological safety :  
Everyone feels safe in taking risks around their team members, and that they won’t be embarrassed or punished for doing so.  
 
2. Dependability :   
Everyone completes quality work on time.

3. Structure and clarity :   
Everyone knows what their specific expectations are. These expectations must be challenging yet attainable.

4. Meaning of work :   
Everyone has a sense of purpose in their work (i.e., financial security, supporting family, helping the team succeed, etc.).

5. Impact of the work :   
Everyone sees that the result of their work actually contributes to the organization’s overall goals.

## Here’s the good news
You don’t have to be one or the other. Having both pragmatic and strong relationship-building traits can increase the value you bring to a team. So whether you’re left brained or right brained, it’s possible to adopt both traits. Here’s how:
* If you’re right brained:

1. Develop a strategic mindset.    
Know and understand what drives company to success.
2. Be known for something.    
Do you have deep expertise in relevant areas? (i.e., financial acumen, scientific expertise or even highly specialized knowledge such as tax law or M&A accounting). Be proactive in mastering them.
3. Practice tackling complex problems.    
This is especially helpful with those tricky interview questions that Google is famous for. Use those linear thinking skills to your advantage by diving deeply into issues.

* If you’re left brained:

1. Develop learning agility.   
Instead of defaulting to the “tried and true” (which pragmatists tend to do), be open to trying varied approaches and new ideas.
2. Find joy in ambiguity.    
Practice coping with uncertainty and making decisions without having all the information beforehand.
3. Put your social leadership skills to the test.    
When was the last time you motivated influenced others or deeply connected with your teammates? You might come to find that you actually enjoy it.

Teams don’t just happen by bringing people together in the same room or connecting them via Skype. When you understand yourself by taking a “good look in the mirror,” you can be the change you want to see in both your team and your company.
