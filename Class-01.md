2. CSS
3. Practical

The first chapter looking at how HTML is used to
create web pages.   
The second chapter that explains how CSS
uses rules to enable you to

And will end up with some helpful
information that will assist you in
building better websites.

Before it look at the code used to build
websites it is important to consider the
different ways in which people access the web
and clarify some terminology. 

## Browsers
People access websites using
software called a web browser.
Popular examples include
Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari,
Chrome, and Opera.
## Web Servers
When you ask your browser for
a web page, the request is sent
across the Internet to a special
computer known as a web
server which hosts the website.
## Screen readers
Screen readers are programs
that read out the contents of a
computer screen to a user. They
are commonly used by people
with visual impairments.
## Devices
People are accessing websites
on an increasing range of devices
including desktop computers,
laptops, tablets, and mobile
phones. It is important to
remember that various devices
have different screen sizes and
some have faster connections to
the web than others.

# How Websites Are Created?
Small websites are often written
just using HTML and CSS.
Larger, more complex sites like
these may use a database to
store data, and programming
languages such as PHP, ASP.Net,
Java, or Ruby on the web server,
but you do not need to know
these technologies to improve
what the user sees. The skills
you'll learn in this book should be
enough to help you on that road.
