# The Structure of This Book
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Practical

The first chapter looking at how HTML is used to
create web pages.   
The second chapter that explains how CSS
uses rules to enable you to
control the styling and layout
of web pages.  
And will end up with some helpful
information that will assist you in
building better websites.

Before it look at the code used to build
websites it is important to consider the
different ways in which people access the web
and clarify some terminology. 

## Browsers
People access websites using
software called a web browser.
Popular examples include
Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari,
Chrome, and Opera.
## Web Servers
When you ask your browser for
a web page, the request is sent
across the Internet to a special
computer known as a web
server which hosts the website.
## Screen readers
Screen readers are programs
that read out the contents of a
computer screen to a user. They
are commonly used by people
with visual impairments.
## Devices
People are accessing websites
on an increasing range of devices
including desktop computers,
laptops, tablets, and mobile
phones. It is important to
remember that various devices
have different screen sizes and
some have faster connections to
the web than others.

# How Websites Are Created?
Small websites are often written
just using HTML and CSS.
Larger, more complex sites like
these may use a database to
store data, and programming
languages such as PHP, ASP.Net,
Java, or Ruby on the web server,
but you do not need to know
these technologies to improve
what the user sees. The skills
you'll learn in this book should be
enough to help you on that road.

# How the Web Works ?

1. When you connect to the web,
you do so via an Internet Service
Provider (ISP). You type a
domain name or web address
into your browser to visit a site.   

2. Your computer contacts a
network of servers called
Domain Name System (DNS)
servers. These act like phone
books; they tell your computer
the IP address associated with
the requested domain name.  

3. The unique number that the
DNS server returns to your
computer allows your browser
to contact the web server
that hosts the website you
requested.  

4. The web server then sends the
page you requested back to your
web browser.

# What Is Structure In HTML ?
Structure consists of the mandatory parts of an HTML document plus the semantic and structured markup of its contents. Presentation is the style you give the content. In most cases presentation is about the way a document looks, but it can also affect how a document sounds – not everybody uses a graphical web browser.

# HTML Uses Elements To Describe The Structure Of Pages
## Look at this code, there are several different elements. Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag.

# Opening Tag && Closing Tag
![image](https://clearlydecoded.com/assets/images/posts/2017-09-04-anatomy-of-html-tag/simple-p-tag.png)

An opening tag begins a section of page content, and a closing tag ends it. For example, to markup a section of text as a paragraph, you would open the paragraph with an opening paragraph "tag p tag" and close it with a closing paragraph "tag /p tag".
(closing tags always proceed the element with a /).

## What Is Attribute ?
Attributes define additional characteristics or properties of the element such as width and height of an image. Attributes are always specified in the start tag (or opening tag) and usually consists of name/value pairs like name="value". 
Attribute values should always be enclosed in quotation marks.

# A Summary Of Structure (pp.12-39)
* HTML pages are text documents.
* HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
* Tags are often referred to as elements.
* Tags usually come in pairs.The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
* Attributes require a name and a value.
* To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.

# Extra Markup Chapter
## Specifying different versions of HTML

## Let’s see the significance of the individual Versions of Html :
* HTML 1.0
* HTML 2
* HTML 3.2
* HTML 4.01
* HTML5
The latest version of HTML (HTML5) For a developer, it could be used in 2014. It came up with lots of HTML tags support. HTML5 provided support for new form elements like input element s of different types.

# Identifying and grouping elements
## CSS Identification & Grouping of elements
Identification of elements is done with class and id properties.
And grouping is done with div and span properties.
Identification and grouping of elements is useful when we want to divide our web page into different sections or sub sections.
