    <h4>
        Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 
        The first case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.[6] The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.
        Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. 
        Symptoms begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. Of those people who develop noticeable symptoms, 
        most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, 
        hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, 
        or multiorgan dysfunction). At least a third of the people who are infected with the virus remain asymptomatic 
        and do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time, but they still can spread the disease.
        The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly when an infected person is in close contact with another person.
        Small droplets and aerosols containing the virus can spread from an infected person's nose and mouth as they breathe, 
        cough, sneeze, sing, or speak. Other people are infected if the virus gets into their mouth, nose or eyes. 
        The virus may also spread via contaminated surfaces, although this is not thought to be the main route of transmission.
        The exact route of transmission is rarely proven conclusively,but infection mainly happens when people are near each other for long enough. 
        People who are infected can transmit the virus to another person up to two days before they themselves show symptoms, as can people who do not experience symptoms. 
        People remain infectious for up to ten days after the onset of symptoms in moderate cases and up to 20 days in severe cases.Several testing methods have been developed to diagnose the disease. 
        The standard diagnostic method is by detection of the virus' nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), 
        or by loop-mediated isothermal amplification from a nasopharyngeal swab.
