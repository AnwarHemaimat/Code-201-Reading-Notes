Controlling the size and alignment of
your images using CSS keeps rules that
affect the presentation of your page in
the CSS and out of the HTML markup.
## Controlling sizes of images in CSS
You can control the size of an
image using the width and
height properties in CSS, just
like you can for any other box.
## Aligning images using CSS
webpage authors are increasingly
using the float property to align
images. There are two ways that
this is commonly achieved:
1. The float property is added
to the class that was created to
represent the size of the image
(such as the small class in our
example).
2. New classes are created with
names such as align-left or
align-right to align the images
to the left or right of the page.
These class names are used in
addition to classes that indicate
the size of the image.
## Centering images using CSS
There are two common ways in which you
can horizontally center an image:
1. On the containing element,
you can use the text-align
property with a value of center.
2. On the image itself, you can
use the use the margin property
and set the values of the left and
right margins to auto.
## Background images
Background images are often
the last thing on the page to
load (which can make a website
seem slow to load). As with any
images you use online, if the
size of the file is large it will take
longer to download.
## Repeating images
The background-repeat
property can have four values:
* repeat   
The background image is
repeated both horizontally and
vertically (the default way it
is shown if the backgroundrepeat
property isn't used).
* repeat-x    
The image is repeated
horizontally only (as shown in
the first example on the left).
* repeat-y    
The image is repeated vertically
only.
* no-repeat    
The image is only shown once.
* fixed   
The background image stays in
the same position on the page.
* scroll   
The background image moves
up and down as the user scrolls
up and down the page.
## Images rollovers And sprites
Using CSS, it is possible to create
a link or button that changes to a
second style when a user moves
their mouse over it (known as a
rollover) and a third style when
they click on it.
This is achieved by setting a
background image for the link or
button that has three different
styles of the same button (but
only allows enough space to
show one of them at a time). When the user moves their
mouse over the element, or
clicks on it, the position of the
background image is moved to
show the relevant image.

1. You can specify the dimensions o XX f images using CSS. This is very helpful when you use the same sized
images on several pages of your site.
3. Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically
using CSS.
4. You can use a background image behind the box
created by any element on a page.
5. Background images can appear just once or be
repeated across the background of the box.
6. You can create image rollover effects by moving the
background position of an image.
7. To reduce the number of images your browser has to
load, you can create image sprites.
