# Error Handling & Debugging
JavaScript can be hard to learn and everyone makes mistakes when writing it.
When you are writing JavaScript, do not expect to write it perfectly the first time. Programming is like problem solving: you are given a puzzle and not only do you have to solve it, but you also need to create the instructions that allow the computer to solve it, too.
## What is error handling and debugging?
Errors, bugs, and therefore debugging are a part of life for a programmer. Error handling is a combination of coding and methodology that allows your program to anticipate user and other errors. It allows you to create a robust program.

## What is error handling in JavaScript?
JavaScript is a loosely-typed language. JavaScript provides error-handling mechanism to catch runtime errors using try-catch-finally block, similar to other languages like Java or C#.

## How do you handle errors in JavaScript?
The try statement lets you test a block of code for errors. The catch statement lets you handle the error. The throw statement lets you create custom errors. The finally statement lets you execute code, after try and catch, regardless of the result.

## What is debugging in JS?
The debugger statement stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function. Using the debugger statement has the same function as setting a breakpoint in the code. Normally, you activate debugging in your browser with the F12 key, and select "Console" in the debugger menu.

## The Stack
## What is the concept of stack?
A stack is an Abstract Data Type (ADT).
In computing, a stack is a data structure used to store a collection of objects. Individual items can be added and stored in a stack using a push operation.Stacks have several applications in commuter programming. LIFO stacks, for example, can be used to retrieve recently used objects, from a cache.
## Why is stack used?
Stacks are used to implement functions, parsers, expression evaluation, and backtracking algorithms.That is, that a stack is a Last In First Out (LIFO) structure. As an abstract entity, a stack is defined by the operations of adding items to the stack, push(), and the operation of removing items from the stack, pop().
